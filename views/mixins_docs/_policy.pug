  h5.headerLink#m13 Legal Bases for the Processing
  p
  | In the following we inform you about the legal basis of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the regulations of the GDPR, the national data protection regulations may apply in your country or in our country of residence or domicile. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.
  ul
  li
    strong Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR)
    |  - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.
  li
    strong Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR)
    |  - Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
  li
    strong Compliance with a legal obligation (Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR)
    |  - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.
  li
    strong Protection of vital interests (Article 6 (1) (d) GDPR)
    |  - Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
  li
    strong Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR)
    |  - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
  p
  strong National data protection regulations in Germany
  | : In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations apply to data protection in Germany. This includes in particular the Law on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions on the right to access, the right to erase, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (§ 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, execution or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.
  
  h5.headerLink#m200 Provision of mobile aplication Samply Research
  
  p 
  strong User Provided Information: 
  | The application obtains the information you provide when you download and register the application. 
  | Registration with us is mandatory in order to be able to use the basic features of the application.
  | When you register with us and use the application, you provide 
  | (a) your email address and password; 
  | (b) your smartphone's timezone and language;
  | (c) timestamps for the following events: receving a notification in the app, tapping on the notification in the notification bar, opening a notification in the app, deleting a notification, completing a survey;

  | (e) information you enter into our system when using the application, such as when joining a study;
  | (f) your current location information and timestamps for geofencing events when using the application and when the application is closed, if you participate in a study that uses geofencing.

  p 
  strong Using your current location at the background: 
  | Some of the studies may require sending you a link to online surveys when you enter or leave a particular location (e.g., workplace).
  | For this reason, if you join a study that uses type of contact with participants, you will be asked to allow constant location tracking. 
  | If you agree, the application will continuously track your location even when the application is closed.
  | The application will not share your location data with third party services or researchers. 
  | Your location information will be only used to trigger notifications with links to online surveys that are created by researchers.
  | You can always enable or disable location tracking for a specific study within the application.
  | If you do not want us to use your location for the above purposes, you should turn off the location services for the mobile application located in your account settings or in your mobile phone settings and/or within the mobile application. 
  
  p
  strong Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information:
  |  You can stop all collection of information by the application by deleting your account (under the menu item "More", then "Settings", then "Delete my account") and uninstalling the application. 
  | You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

  h5.headerLink#m225 Provision of online services and web hosting
  p
  | In order to provide our online services at the Samply website (https://samply.uni-konstanz.de/), we use the infrastructure (web server, computing capacity, storage space, database services, security and technical maintenance services) of the University of Konstanz in Germany. 
  p
  | The data processed within the framework of the provision of the website include all information relating to the users of the mobile application Samply Research and the Samply website that is collected in the course of use and communication. 
  | Participant data and timestamps of notifications are stored in the secure database and are only accessible to the researchers of the respective study that collected this data. 
  | Researchers can delete this data via the Samply website interface. 
  p
  strong E-mail Sending and Hosting
  | : The web hosting services we use also include sending, receiving and storing e-mails. For these purposes, the addresses of the recipients and senders, as well as other information relating to the sending of e-mails (e.g. the providers involved) and the contents of the respective e-mails are processed. The above data may also be processed for SPAM detection purposes. Please note that e-mails on the Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted during transport, but not on the servers from which they are sent and received (unless a so-called end-to-end encryption method is used). We can therefore accept no responsibility for the transmission path of e-mails between the sender and reception on our server.
  p
  strong Collection of Access Data and Log Files
  | : We, ourselves or our web hosting provider, collect data on the basis of each access to the server (so-called server log files). Server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, the date and time of access, data volumes transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a general rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider.
  p
  | The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g. to avoid overloading the servers (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and to ensure the stability and optimal load balancing of the servers .
  
  p
  strong Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information:
  |  Website users (researchers and participants) can manage their accounts via the Samply website interface. Users can delete their account using the menu item "Account",  then "Delete my account".

  h5.headerLink#m27 Security Precautions
  p
  | We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the  state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
  p
  | The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and service providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.
  p
  strong Masking of the IP address
  | : In general, the IP addresses of researchers and participants are not recorded and stored. In the event that this should happen in the future, we will shorten your IP address or have it shortened. When the IP address is shortened, also known as "IP masking", the last octet, i.e. the last two numbers of an IP address, is deleted (the IP address in this context is an identifier individually assigned to an Internet connection by the online access provider). With the shortening of the IP address, the identification of a person on the basis of their IP address is to be prevented or made considerably more difficult.
  p
  strong SSL encryption (https)
  | : In order to protect your data transmitted via our online services in the best possible way, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser.
  h5.headerLink#m25 Transmission and Disclosure of Personal Data
  p
  | In the context of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to other places, companies or persons or that it is disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, payment institutions within the context of payment transactions, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are embedded in a website. In such a case, the legal requirements will be respected and in particular corresponding contracts or agreements, which serve the protection of your data, will be concluded with the recipients of your data.
  h5.headerLink#m24 Data Processing in Third Countries
  p
  | If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third party services or disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this will only take place in accordance with the legal requirements.
  p
  | Subject to express consent or transfer required by contract or law, we process or have processed the data only in third countries with a recognised level of data protection, on the basis of special guarantees, such as a contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission or if certifications or binding internal data protection regulations justify the processing (Article 44 to 49 GDPR, information page of the EU Commission: 
  a(href='https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en')
    | https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en).
  
  h5.headerLink#m134 Use of Cookies
  p
  | We do not use third-party cookies or cookies for statistics, marketing and personalisation. We only use necessary (essential) cookies that are required for the operation of a website (e.g. user authentication). 
  p
  | Cookies are text files that contain data from visited websites or domains and are stored by a browser on the user's computer. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user during or after his visit within an online service. The information stored can include, for example, the language settings on a website, the login status, a shopping basket or the location where a video was viewed. The term "cookies" also includes other technologies that fulfil the same functions as cookies (e.g. if user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also referred to as "user IDs").
  p
  strong The following types and functions of cookies are distinguished:
  ul
  li
    strong Temporary cookies (also: session cookies): 
    | Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online service and closed his browser.
  li
    strong Permanent cookies:
    | Permanent cookies remain stored even after closing the browser. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. The interests of users who are used for range measurement or marketing purposes can also be stored in such a cookie.
  li
    strong First-Party-Cookies
    | : First-Party-Cookies are set by ourselves.
  li
    strong Third party cookies
    | : Third party cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process user information.
  li
    strong Necessary (also: essential) cookies:
    |  Cookies can be necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to save logins or other user inputs or for security reasons).
  li
    strong Statistics, marketing and personalisation cookies
    | : Cookies are also generally used to measure a website's reach and when a user's interests or behaviour (e.g. viewing certain content, using functions, etc.) are stored on individual websites in a user profile. Such profiles are used, for example, to display content to users that corresponds to their potential interests. This procedure is also referred to as "tracking", i.e. tracking the potential interests of users. If we use cookies or "tracking" technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy or in the context of obtaining consent.
  p
  strong Information on legal basis:
  |  The legal basis on which we process your personal data with the help of cookies depends on whether we ask you for your consent. If this applies and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for processing your data is your declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online service and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.
  p
  strong Retention period: 
  | Unless we provide you with explicit information on the retention period of permanent cookies (e.g. within the scope of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the retention period can be as long as two years.
  p
  strong General information on Withdrawal of consent and objection (Opt-Out): 
  | Respective of whether processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to object to the processing of your data using cookie technologies or to revoke consent (collectively referred to as "opt-out"). You can initially explain your objection using the settings of your browser, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (which may also restrict the functionality of our online services). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can be raised for a large number of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the websites 
  a(href='https://www.aboutads.info/choices/') https://www.aboutads.info/choices/
  |  and 
  a(href='https://www.youronlinechoices.com.') https://www.youronlinechoices.com.
  |  In addition, you can receive further information on objections in the context of the information on the used service providers and cookies.
  p
  strong Processing Cookie Data on the Basis of Consent
  | : Before we process or have processed data within the context of the usage of cookies, we ask the users for their consent, which can be revoked at any time. Before the consent has not been given, we may use cookies that are necessary for the operation of our online services.

  h5.headerLink#m42 Terminology and Definitions
  p
  | This section provides an overview of the terms used in this privacy policy. Many of the terms are drawn from the law and defined mainly in Article 4 GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are intended above all for the purpose of comprehension. The terms are sorted alphabetically.
  ul.glossary
  li
    strong Controller:
    |  "Controller" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
  li
    strong Personal Data:
    |  "personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
  li
    strong Processing:
    |  The term "processing" covers a wide range and practically every handling of data, be it collection, evaluation, storage, transmission or erasure.
  li
    strong Remarketing:
    |  Remarketing" or "retargeting" is the term used, for example, to indicate for advertising purposes which products a user is interested in on a website in order to remind the user of these products on other websites, e.g. in advertisements.
  li
    strong Targeting:
    |  "Tracking" is the term used when the behaviour of users can be traced across several websites. As a rule, behavior and interest information with regard to the websites used is stored in cookies or on the servers of the tracking technology providers (so-called profiling). This information can then be used, for example, to display advertisements to users presumably corresponding to their interests.
  li
    strong Web Analytics:
    |  Web Analytics serves the evaluation of visitor traffic of online services and can determine their behavior or interests in certain information, such as content of websites. With the help of web analytics, website owners, for example, can recognize at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This allows them, for example, to optimize the content of the website to better meet the needs of their visitors. For purposes of web analytics, pseudonymous cookies and web beacons are frequently used in order to recognise returning visitors and thus obtain more precise analyses of the use of an online service.
