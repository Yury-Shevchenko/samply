## Samply

Samply makes sending notifications easy and provides a secure foundation for connection with your participants. The application has an open source code on GitHub and runs online at https://samply.ml. With Samply you can schedule notifications for experience-based sampling studies. In the current moment, only Android mobile devices are supported.

## Features

* Only Android mobile devices
* Different types of notifications schedule (one-time, repeat, event-based)
* Customization of messages (content, url)
* User authorization - you can identify the unique id number of each participant.
* Security: participants do not need to provide any personal information such as email or phone number. All notifications are send through the application.
