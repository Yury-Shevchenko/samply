When you are ready to launch or test your study, toggle the left switch to activate it. Once your study is active, you will receive a unique web page link displayed on the study card. This link can be shared with participants to join your study in the mobile app. The second toggle switch can make your study public in the mobile app, visible to all app users in the list of public studies.

		"advantage_1": "More and more studies in social sciences are being implemented online. However, there are barriers to the use of the Internet. First, technical difficulties in conducting an online-experiment. Even if a simple questionnaire is not a problem, an experimental paradigm is already a burden for researchers who want to collect data online.",
		"advantage_2": "Second, although the replicability crisis has triggered a number of important innovations such as study pre-registration, open access to data and analysis methods, the methods of data collection are often concealed under general specifications in the method section. Especially in online experiments, where the software is directly accessible to a participant, the code and parameters of the user-computer interaction are rarely documented and opened for other researchers.",
		"advantage_3": "Thirdly, data security is difficult for a researcher who is just beginning to program his or her own study. Not every available service supports secure data transmission from a participant to the server. Also, the personal information (e.g., email address) is often stored together with the results of the experiment.",
		"advantage_4": "To overcome these limitations, Samply offers a researcher a way to conduct an online-study without technical difficulties. It frees time to focus on more important methodological and data analysis work. The experiments are automatically documented and stored so that cooperation with colleagues and meta-analyses of previous studies are possible. The HTTPS protocol ensures that participants' data is encrypted during transmission.
