        'advantage_1': `More and more studies in social sciences are being implemented online.
            However, there are barriers to the use of the Internet.
            First, technical difficulties in conducting an online-experiment.
            Even if a simple questionnaire is not a problem, an experimental paradigm is already a burden for researchers who want to collect data online.`,
        'advantage_2': `Second, although the replicability crisis has triggered a number of important innovations such as study pre-registration, open access to data and analysis methods, the methods of data collection are often concealed under general specifications in the method section.
            Especially in online experiments, where the software is directly accessible to a participant, the code and parameters of the user-computer interaction are rarely documented and opened for other researchers.`,
        'advantage_3': `Thirdly, data security is difficult for a researcher who is just beginning to program his or her own study.
            Not every available service supports secure data transmission from a participant to the server.
            Also, the personal information (e.g., email address) is often stored together with the results of the experiment.`,
        'advantage_4': `To overcome these limitations, Samply offers a researcher a way to conduct an online-study without technical difficulties.
            It frees time to focus on more important methodological and data analysis work.
            The experiments are automatically documented and stored so that cooperation with colleagues and meta-analyses of previous studies are possible.
            The HTTPS protocol ensures that participants' data is encrypted during transmission.
            User access to experiments can be protected by various authentication strategies such as participant codes, e-mails, passwords or accounts on social networks.`,

            The question about the notifications should appear automatically on the screen.
            Participants will also need to create a new account.
            The login information is stored securely on the Samply server (which is the server of the University of Konstanz in Germany)
